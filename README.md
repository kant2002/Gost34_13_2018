# Standard on block chipher in Kazakhstan

Code from https://ksm.kz/public-discussion/standards/discussion-of-draft-of-st-rk/112716/

Here I have 3 implementations
- C++, original one.
- C# in GostCSharp folder
- F# in GostFSharp folder
- F* in GostFStar folder. This is highly experimental and not finished yet.

# Interesting read.
